# Utility Module

Dart's standard `math` module provides trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) that operate on angles expressed in radians.

As humans often find it more intuitive to work with angles in degrees (e.g., 360Â° for a full circle), this module offers helper methods to simplify trigonometric calculations using degree-based inputs.

Also, the methods and functions in `Bullseye2D` take angles always in degree (for example the `gfx.rotate` or `gfx.drawImage` method).

Additionally, this module includes `Rect`, a generic class for representing rectangular areas and various extension and helpers.

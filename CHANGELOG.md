## 1.0.4

- Added `View source code` button to demo page.

## 1.0.3

- Remove `example` command. It was a bad idea in the first place, because the way I've implemented it assumes it could be run from local dart cache and dart doesn't like this (for good reasons). So I removed the command for now.

## 1.0.2

- Fixes `Cannot operate on packages inside the cache.` error on `example` command.

## 1.0.1

- Fixes an issue with the `example` command of the `bullseye2d` cli tool.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
